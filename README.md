# LuxuryCars-NLP-Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes user-generated content from Edmunds forums to uncover insights into user behavior, preferences, and trends. By leveraging web scraping and natural language processing (NLP), the project collects and processes data to perform in-depth textual analysis. Key objectives include identifying recurring topics, analyzing sentiment, and understanding user engagement on the platform. This analysis can inform business strategies, such as improving customer support, identifying product improvement opportunities, and enhancing user engagement strategies.

## Features
- **Web Scraping**: Automates the extraction of forum discussions, including metadata such as user IDs, dates, and comments.
- **Data Cleaning**: Prepares raw data by handling missing values, removing special characters, and eliminating stopwords for more accurate analysis.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Applies tokenization, frequency analysis, and topic modeling to understand user sentiment and key discussion points.
- **Data Visualization**: Provides graphical insights (e.g., word clouds, frequency distributions) to better interpret the results.

### Detailed Workflow
1. **Web Scraping**: Uses Selenium to navigate and extract discussions from multiple pages of the Edmunds forum.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Implements preprocessing steps to refine the scraped text for analysis.
3. **NLP Analysis**: Employs NLTK for tokenization, stopword removal, and word frequency computation.
4. **Visualization**: Creates plots to showcase the most frequently discussed topics, trends over time, and sentiment distributions.
